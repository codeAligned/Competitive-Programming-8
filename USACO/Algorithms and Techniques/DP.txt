Dynamic Programming

Definition

Dynamic programming (DP) is a general algorithm design technique for solving problems with overlapping sub-problems. This technique was invented by American mathematician “Richard Bellman” in 1950s.

Key Idea

The key idea is to save answers of overlapping smaller sub-problems to avoid recomputation.

Dynamic Programming Properties

- An instance is solved using the solutions for smaller instances.
- The solutions for a smaller instance might be needed multiple times, so store their results in a table.
- Thus each smaller instance is solved only once.
- Additional space is used to save time.

To apply dynamic programming

1. Find the recursion in the problem
2. Build a table of possible values
3. Find the right order to evaluate the results so that partial results are available when needed.

If any of the steps is not applicable chances are the dynamic programming won't help to solve the problem.
